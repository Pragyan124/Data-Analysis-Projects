# **World Suicide Data Analysis Dashboard**

## Introduction:
This project aims to analyze the suicide data in various countries from the year 1985-2016, and see if GDP of a country can alone be a factor responsible in the increasing suicide cases.

## About the dataset:
The dataset contains names of various countries,different years, different age groups, genders, gdp per capita, gdp of the year,no. og suicide, suicide per 100k population, different generation group.

## Insights :

•	We can see larger number of suicide cases in the countries such as Russian Federation ,United States, and Japan etc.

•	We can see a large number of suicides by the males i.e., around 76.89% compared to females which is 23.11%  .

•	From the third visualization we can see that we have a large number of suicide comitted by the adults compared to the other age groups i.e., around 36.34% followed by Middle-aged i.e., around 24.58% 


•	We see a  increase  in suicide cases from the year 1988 and a decrease in suicide cases from the year 2014.

•	From the 5th visualization we can see that country's GDP doesn't play a direct role in the causes of suicides . Let us  take example of Spain. We can see that the GDP  of the country is below average but the suicide cases are low too. While, in countries like USA, with average GDP the suicide numbers are highest.


## Conclusion:
The Dashboard aims to create a comprehensive analysis using the dataset provided. By visualizing the data through different perspectives, we can see that GDP of the country has no major role in the causes of Suicides by different age groups.
